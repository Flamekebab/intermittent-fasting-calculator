# Intermittent Fasting Calculator

I was given some parameters by my partner and had a go at implementing them. Not my best work, I will admit, but a fun challenge. With any luck I'll add some better functionality and maybe a GUI for desktop use. It was written to be simple though so it could be run through a Python interpreter on their Android phone. It might be fun to try to rewrite it to not use the random library though to make it more self-contained.

I think this also might be my first use of classes in Python. I've done a lot of stuff like it in JavaScript and in Sugarcube but this is probably my first use of them here as I've not needed them in the other things I've written.

Basically it was something I knocked together one evening after vast amounts of swearing at the existing apps available to them!
